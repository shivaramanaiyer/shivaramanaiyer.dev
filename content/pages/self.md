Hello! I am Shivaraman Aiyer, a Full-Stack Developer, experienced with work with PHP, Node.js, React.js, Android and Wordpress.

I have worked on Open-Source projects in the past and am keen to get back into it and give my contribution to the this amazing world.

I have tried my hand at maintaining a website with posts that interest me in the tech world but have sadly failed at it in the past. With this website, I hope to keep it running for the foreseeable future and really hope that you find at least one thing that you are interested about.

> This is by no means a complete site at the moment and will have more information coming in the future...
