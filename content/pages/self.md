Having thought about this page a thousand times over and never finding the right way to say things, here is all the not so right ways to describe myself.

I am a Full-Stack developer who is looking into break into the Cybersecurity world. Full-stack wise, I believe I am good with PHP, JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, Android and Wordpress as these are the frameworks and languages I have been working with for the majority of the last decade.

With this website, I want to make it a habit of writing down things that I have worked on as a general log. So things like, CTF write-ups, general concepts of programming, security, photography maybe and others that I feel like writing about.
