Hello! I am Shivaraman Aiyer, a Full-Stack Developer, experienced with work with PHP, Node.js, React.js, Android and Wordpress.

I currently am working with [Deluxe Entertainment Services Group](https://www.bydeluxe.com) in Bangalore, India, on the [Sfera Studios](sferastudios.com). I am mainly working on PHP, Yii 1.1 and ReactJs these days and learning about Cybersecurity through the edx.org course on [Cybersecurity Micro Masters](https://www.edx.org/micromasters/ritx-cybersecurity)

With this website, I hope to keep it running for the foreseeable future and really hope that you find at least one thing that you are interested about.

> This is by no means a complete site at the moment and will have more information coming in the future...
