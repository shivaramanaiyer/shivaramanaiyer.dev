Just today I realised something, I have been waking up nearly everyday for the 86 days (since we moved to Canada), without snoozing my alarm. There have been a few days where I have snoozed it for another 5 mins but seldom more. And that made me realise something. For the first time since I heard about the [#100daysofX](https://www.100daysofx.com/), I was actually close to doing something consistently for a 100 days and I wasn't even thinking about this challenge.

In the past, I have tried to do the 100 days of X challenge in some aspects of my life without success. But, today, I wanted to know the reason behind my consistency for the last 86 days! You may be thinking, well I wake up everyday on the first sound of my alarm. What is so special about you? Nothing special. It is great that you have been able to achieve this already. But for me, in the past, waking up at 5 AM in the morning seemed like an impossible task. But today, I can say that I can complete my sleep and wake up fresh at any time, like I have been waking up at 2:30 AM (not relevant to this post) for the last 3 weeks, without a problem.

## So let's just get right into it!

A few questions we will try to find answers for. Why the sudden success? What was I doing differently to keep me going? How can I keep up with this for the future and for other tasks that I wanna do more consistently?

### Answers

After much thinking, I believe the success at this task was achieved by one major factor ***MOTIVATION***. What motivation? 
There were a few actually:
- Jet lag made it easy to get up for the first few days :D
- The hotel I was quarantining in served food at 8 AM and dinner at 6 PM. So didn't have much to do afterwards
- I had to get up at 5 AM while still being sensible to get max time overlap with my client

So for the first few days, jetlag helped in making it difficult to sleep beyond 5, heck, both my wife and I would wake up at 3 sometimes and go to bed by 7. This craziness set the seed for a routine we didn't really expect to start. It was like learning to ride a bike with training wheels, only here the training wheels were forcing me to ride the bike. The next few days of forced behaviour of the hotel's schedule sealed the habit in. The rest just was easy to follow and the need to have maximum time overlap with my client, made sure I didn't slack at all.

### Conclusion

In order to start something new, something you've never done before, you need to stay motivated. It doesn't have to be an active motivation, could be a passive one, like the first few days in my case. But, once your ride the first few days in this new habit, I am sure it will be like second nature and you will never look back.

I know now what I need to do to be consistent with any change I want to achieve in myself.
